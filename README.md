## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.
This was my first time working with API and fetch functions. Therefore, it was a great opportunity to more in-depth understanding on how asyn functions in JS work, as well as, get more practise and understading of promises.

Project idea was from:

## The challenge

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See their own IP Address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location
